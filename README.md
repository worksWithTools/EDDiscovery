EDDiscovery is a captain's log and 2D/3D map for Elite Dangerous players. Find more information in the [EDDiscovery wiki](https://github.com/EDDiscovery/EDDiscovery/wiki).

This fork adds a simple android client for the EDDiscovery main app, interfacing via a new .NET plugin that hosts a websockets server to facilitate comms between the two.
As of today it's only early days - there's a main screen that doesn't show much beyond the last entry, and a log screen that shows the last 10 events.
That's it.
Very much a work in progres...
